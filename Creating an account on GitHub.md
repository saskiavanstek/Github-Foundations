# Creating an personal account on GitHub

>[!TIP]
>To get started with GitHub, you'll need to create a free personal account and verify your email address.
>Every person who uses GitHub signs in to a user account. Your user account is your identity on GitHub and has a username and profile.
>For example, see [Octocat's GitHub Profile](https://github.com/octocat)
>
>Later, you can explore the different types of accounts that GitHub offers, and decide if you need a billing plan.
>For more information, see [Types of GitHub accounts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts) and [GitHub's plans](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans)

## Signing up for a new personal account

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
2. Click **Sign up**

>[!NOTE]
>During sign up, you'll be asked to verify your email address.
